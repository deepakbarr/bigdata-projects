1. Real time

     Compute the D/S ratio every minute considering last 10 minutes of historical data. "windowing"
     put this in redis cache as key,value (key=geohash, value = ratio)... TTL x minutes

2. Batch

   Run micro batches every 10 minutes and take events for last 10 minutes, and insert into druid.
   Druid will run aggregation on hourly/daily basis



---------
I have to run every 10 minutes, seems like no use case of real time





Questions -

1. Every 10 minutes ????
2. Lat lon - where is the exact data.
3. One machine - deploy everything there...
4. How the results will be served for real time.
