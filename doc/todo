To Study
---------------
<Add code comments>
1. Kafka Mirror
2. New different data...... 5-6 new geo hashes
3. Read input and output data from S3

------------------
Deploy on AWS

1. install vim
sudo yum install vim
2. install telnet
sudo yum install telnet
2. install java
sudo yum localinstall jdk-8u151-linux-x64.rpm
3  Install redis on aws (https://medium.com/@andrewcbass/install-redis-v3-2-on-aws-ec2-instance-93259d40a3ce)
4. install redis commander (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8205369/installing-npm-on-aws-ec2)
sudo npm install -g redis-commander
4. install confluent
6. edit ./etc/kafka/server.properties - changed advertised host, and enable deletion of topic
7. install imply
6. Disable caching and set refresh rate to 1 min on pivot UI



--------------------------------
Commands for AWS setup


New things to try
------------------
0. Storm cleanup
1. Joining of streams
2. java script maps
3. presentation/ppt
4. generate datasets with more data in druid
5. finalize colors
new
6. write main method in visualization classes
7. use some env variable for IP on AWS
8. revisit batch version 2
9. why realtime tasks are taking so long to finish

----- Flume - read from kafka and write to file as well as druid
event time vs processing time
lambda architecture
concerns
event time shud be considered
late events shud be handled by batch and correct data in druid eventually
what if one bolt is slow and other is fast
